Calculator Unit Tests
This project contains unit tests for basic arithmetic operations in the Calculator class. The following operations are tested:

Addition
Subtraction

Division
The tests are implemented using pytest and make use of parametrized testing to cover a wide variety of inputs and expected outputs. Additionally, they handle cases where exceptions such as TypeError and ZeroDivisionError are expected.
